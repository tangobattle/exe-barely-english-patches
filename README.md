# BARELY USABLE EXE4/5 ENGLISH PATCHES

THESE ARE BARELY USABLE ENGLISH PATCHES FOR EXE4 AND EXE5. THEY JUST REPLACE CHIP NAMES AND NAVICUST PROGRAM NAMES WITH ENGLISH TEXT SO YOU CAN TELL WHAT THE HELL THE OPPONENT IS DOING IF YOU DON'T KNOW JAPANESE.

EVERYTHING IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT WAS THE EASIEST WAY TO DO IT. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
