# BARELY ENGLISH EXE4/5 PATCHES

THESE ARE BARELY ENGLISH PATCHES FOR EXE4 AND EXE5. THEY JUST REPLACE CHIP NAMES, NAVICUST PROGRAM NAMES, AND MODCARD NAMES WITH ENGLISH TEXT SO YOU CAN TELL WHAT THE HELL THE OPPONENT IS DOING IF YOU DON'T KNOW JAPANESE.

EVERYTHING IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT WAS THE EASIEST WAY TO DO IT. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

## BUILDING

USE `make_rom.py` TO BUILD THE OUTPUT ROM. YOU WILL NEED BOTH A COPY OF THE EXE ROM AND THE BN ROM.

```sh
./make_rom.py config.toml bn.gba exe.gba out.gba
```

## THANK YOUS
